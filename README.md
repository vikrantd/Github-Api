# Github-Api
To check issues of a repository on github


This project can get the issues of a repository time wise, like from beginning to 24 hours, 24 hours to 7 days and beyond seven days. User just has to enter the full url of his/her repository. It also displays the total issues of last seven days with the user name who raised the issue and its profile picture. 

It also checks for the errors and if there is any error it displays the error block.

If more time is given we can make a pagination for the issues, sort them like Last 24 hours issues, 24 Hours to 7 Days Issues and Beyond 7 Days Issues.
